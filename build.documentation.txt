   Check/Set Version
     Edit CommonAssemblyInfo.cs in VoltDB.Data.Client -> Properties
     Modify 2 version numbers in "AssemblyVersion" and "AssemblyFileVersion"
   Ensure "Release" build configuration is set (this is visible in the toolbar, if not do the following 3 tasks).
     + "Expert Settings" must be enabled, Tools -> Settings -> Expert Settings
